# Preface 

I started this online book as background material for the course Network Analysis and from the need to teach social science students (including Business Administration and econmonics students) the very basics of `R` and the intuition behing applying linear regression. I intend to work on this book on the fly meaning that during courses I try to see what the needs of students really are. Moreover, during the year I intend to add additional chapters, specifically about the use of stated preference modeling--and its corresponding logit estimation--and working with geographical data. Obviously, all in `R`. At the moment this book really has not yet passed its infant stage. Therefore, all input in the form of comments, critique and remarks are *highly* appreciated.
