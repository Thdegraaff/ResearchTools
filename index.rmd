# Preface 

I started this online book as background material for the course Network Analysis and from the need to teach social science students (which includes Business Administration and Economics students) the a basic understanding of `R`, network techniques and the intuition behing applying linear regression. I intend to work on this book on the fly meaning that during courses I try to see what the needs of students really are. Moreover, over the coming years I intend to add additional chapters, specifically about the use of stated preference modeling--and its corresponding logit estimation--and working with geographical data. Obviously, all in `R`. At the moment this book still has not yet passed its infant stage. Therefore, all input in the form of additions, comments, critique and remarks are *highly* appreciated.
